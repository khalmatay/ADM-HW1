# ADM-HW1
## Author Nurbek Khalmatay

## Overview

This repository contains the first homework for the ADM course in 2024. Initially, I made commits and wrote code in separate files for each topic. However, after solving the regular expressions exercises (`regex`), I decided to write all the solutions in a single file for easier checking and don't create files.
## Repository Structure

- **amazon_labs/**: Pdf files of amazon labs.
- **stamps/**: Keeps pdf all submissions in problem1 and problem2.
- **scripts/**:
    - **scripts.ipynb/**: All solutions for check.
  - **solutions_by_topic/**: 
    - `built_ins.ipynb`
    - `collections.ipynb`
    - `data_types.ipynb`
    - `date_time.ipynb`
    - `exceptions.ipynb`
    - `functionals.ipynb`
    - `introduction.ipynb`
    - `regex.ipynb`
    - `sets.ipynb`
    - `strings.ipynb`

- `.gitignore`: 
- `LICENSE`: 
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Notes: Maybe when I copied my solutions from Hackerank to jupyter, I could make mistakes, but I solved that task. Pls write me khalmatay.2184569@studenti.uniroma1.it
